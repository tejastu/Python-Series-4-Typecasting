# Python-Series-4-Typecasting

There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

1. int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by rounding down to the previous whole number), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)<br>

2 .float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)<br>

3. str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals
